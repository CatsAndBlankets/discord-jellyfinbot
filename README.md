# discord-jellyfinbot
A Discord bot for a local Jellyfin server.

Search through your media library and control your jellyfin server. This is made for my personal use, somethings may not work.

This bot uses custom prefix commands. Adjustments can be made to have it use slash commands, this is just not the direction I wanted to go in.

## Bot permissions needed
- Send messages
- Send Embeds
- Send Embeded Links (providing link to provide more info on media when using "playing" command)
- Send Attachments (this is to provide the poster images within jellyfin when using the "playing" command)

(This is a work in progress, I'll get to it later)
